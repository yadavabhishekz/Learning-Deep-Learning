# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Deep Learning Learning Journey**!  
This repository is a living document of my self-paced path to mastering deep learning â€” through courses, projects, research, and hands-on implementation.

## ðŸ“š Why This Repository?

I've created this repo to:
- âœ… Document everything I learn (notes, code, projects)
- âœ… Build a personal reference I can revisit anytime
- âœ… Share resources and progress with the community
- âœ… Stay accountable and motivated

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Resources

I am currently learning Deep Learning by following the **100 Days of Deep Learning** playlist by **CampusX**, taught by **Nitish Singh**.
He explains every concept in **great depth** and provides **clear & strong intuition** for each topic, which helps build a solid foundation.
**Honestly, CampusX is the best AI/ML YouTube channel Iâ€™ve ever found.**  
The teaching quality, structure, and clarity are unmatched â€” especially the way Nitish Singh simplifies difficult concepts with real intuition.
